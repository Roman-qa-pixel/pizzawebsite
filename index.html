  <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped
  with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
  which is then <a href="baking.html">baked</a> at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
  A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>

  <p>In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife
  and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>

  <p>The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio,
  on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in
  many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America,
  available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.
  Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.</p>

  <p>The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984
  with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza
  was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was
  included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
