<h2 id="largest">Largest Pizza</h2>
    <p>The world's largest pizza was prepared in Rome in December 2012, and measured 1,261 square meters (13,570 square feet). The pizza
      was named "Ottavia" in homage to the first Roman emperor Octavian Augustus, and was made with a gluten-free base. The world's
      longest pizza was made in Fontana, California in 2017 and measured 1,930.39 meters (6,333 feet 3+1⁄2 inches).</p>
<h2 id="expensive">Most Expensive Pizza</h2>
    <p>The world's most expensive pizza listed by Guinness World Records is a commercially available thin-crust pizza at Maze restaurant
      in London, United Kingdom, which costs GB£100. The pizza is wood fire-baked, and is topped with onion puree, white truffle paste,
      fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce, and fresh shavings of a rare Italian
      white truffle.</p>

    <p>There are several instances of more expensive pizzas, such as the GB£4,200 "Pizza Royale 007" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow,
      Scotland, which is topped with caviar, lobster, and 24-carat gold dust, and the US$1,000 caviar pizza made by Nino's Bellissima
      pizzeria in New York City, New York. However, these are not officially recognized by Guinness World Records. Additionally, a pizza
      was made by the restaurateur Domenico Crolla that included toppings such as sunblush-tomato sauce, Scottish smoked salmon,
      medallions of venison, edible gold, lobster marinated in cognac, and champagne-soaked caviar. The pizza was auctioned for charity in
      2007, raising GB£2,150.</p>

<h2 id="worth">Market Worth</h2>
    <p>In 2017, the world pizza market was $128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of
      the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day. A Technomic study concluded that 83% of consumers eat
      pizza at least once per month. According to PMQ in 2018 60.47% of respondents reported an increase in sales over the previous year.</p>
