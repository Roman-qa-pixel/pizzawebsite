      <figcaption><h2>Pizza Baking Process</h2></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven,
      or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven
      on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically
      aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. When made at
      home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly in a metal
      oven results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.</p>

      <h2>Pizza Baking in the Wood Fired Oven</h2>
      <p>Aficionado home-chefs sometimes use a specialty wood-fired pizza
      oven, usually installed outdoors. Dome-shaped pizza ovens have been used for centuries, which is one way to achieve true heat
      distribution in a wood-fired pizza oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill.
      Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven. The bottom of the pizza,
      called the "crust", may vary widely according to style, thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a
      deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese.
      The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione. Pizza dough often contains sugar, both to help its
      yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.</p>

      <h2>Preparing the Pizza Dough</h2>
      <p>When it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With mass production of pizza, the
      process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables.</p> <p>Pizzerias
      nowadays can even opt for high tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.</p>
      <p>Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome 
      challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated
      without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts. Another form of uncooked pizza
      is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own
      ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an
      oven.</p>
